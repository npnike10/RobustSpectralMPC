# RobustSpectralMPC
The framework to implement the robust spectral MPC algorithm developed during my research at IITB

1. PenaltyInvPendRFMPC.nb has the implementation that uses penalty method to construct the cost function. 
2. InvPendRFMPC.nb, if I recall correctly, employs multi-start technique (not a mathematica, just my own so it's naive) to find the max of the minimization problem in min-max formulation. If this doesn't have that, I'll check tomorrow and upload the one which has that.
3. Readme_RFMPC.nb was just for my convenience so it isn't well formatted or complete.
